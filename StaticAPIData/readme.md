## What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></> ?
### Ans-> React Fragments allow you to wrap or group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. This can be useful when rendering multiple child elements/components in a single parent component. React components can only render one element, and if you have multiple elements, the common practice is to wrap them in a single root element, usually a <div> wrapper. This workaround works for most cases, but sometimes adding an extra DOM element is not feasible.
