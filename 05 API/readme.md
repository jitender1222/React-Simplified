## What is a Microservice?

Ans-> MicroServices is an architectural approach for building applications. As an architectural framework microservices are `loosely coupled` which means it allows us to make seperate components which are independent for each other.So if one team changes some code inside the application it won't break the whole app. The benefit of using microservices is that development team are able to rapildy build new component of app to meet the business requirement.

## What is a Monolith Architecture? 

Ans-> Monolith is also an approach for building applications but it is `tightly coupled` which means inside the monolith the different components combined into an single application which results memory leaks type of problem because if we change anything into one place then it can break our entire app and also if we change something then again we have to deployed the whole appliaction.It is one of the reason the applications which builds on monolith provides the updates on year to year.
