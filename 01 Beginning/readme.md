## Q what is the Diff b/w Library and a Framework ?

## Library -> Library is like building your home from the ground up. The house can be made in any style you prefer and the rooms can be arranged and decorated however you like.

 A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks. The term library simply refers to a collection of code that is reused repeatedly. It is essentially a set of pre-defined functions and classes that programmers can use to simplify their work and speed up the development process.

`By using a library, you control the flow of the program. The library can be invoked whenever and wherever you like.`

**Example -> React js,JQuery**

## Framework -> Framework, on the other hand, is like buying a new home. The house is already built, so you don’t have to worry about building problems, but you can’t choose how the rooms are arranged.

A framework is the foundation in which the developer build the applications for specific platforms.A framework is itself an application, it has a wider scope and includes almost everything necessary to make a user application as per his own needs.It includes reusable pieces of code written to perform common tasks and uses code provided by a developer for custom functionality.

`when you use a framework, the flow is controlled by the framework. The framework instructs you where to put your code, but it will call your code as required.`

**Example -> VueJs, Angular JS**
